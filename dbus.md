D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed", and a per-user-login-session daemon Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly
